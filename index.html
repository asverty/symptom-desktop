        <h2 class="section__heading">NOT CONCEPT</h2>
        <p class="section__text">The concept is that there is no concept and this gives me complete freedom. I don’t attach myself to anything, I have a lot of space for thought,because I’m still at the beginning of the way: I study transforming and this is reflected in the design. I experiment a lot with forms, combine different textures and minerals. This technique can be seen in rings with large stones. They can not be repeated, because it uses natural stone, a copy of which can never be found. My jewelry is not distributed by gender - each time it warms my soul to see a guy with a cuff or ring of my design.</p>

        <h2 class="section__heading">MAKE YOUR OWN DESIGN</h2>
        <p class="section__text">Here you can order your own jewelry, which will be created according to your design. Together we will agree on the terms of reference, estimated dates and cost of the product, and then sign an agreement on its creation. We will help to realize any of your ideas - a jewelry can be made of silver or gold, using precious and semiprecious stones, engraving or using enamel. The cost of the product depends on the complexity of the work, as well as on the cost of the selected metals and precious and semiprecious stones, but what cannot be counted in money is the joy of jewelry that will only be with you or the person to whom you will give it.</p>
